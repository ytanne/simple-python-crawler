# Python crawler

Created for fun. Nothing personal behind.

The crawler gets information from [this](https://www.zakon.kz/news/) website. It grabs the title of a news, the date, and the content. The number of comments and comments themselves will be added later... I hope...  

Requirements are listed in 'requirements.txt'. Also, there can be troubles to install **dryscrape**. Try to install software that **dryscrape** depends on. The list can be found in the official [documentations](https://dryscrape.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).

### PS

Found this [comment](https://ibb.co/PZMypws) on their web-site.
Thanks for attention! Have a good one!
